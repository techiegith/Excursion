                <p>A majestic fort with a hilltop setting and an opulent palace within its premises that's Amber Fort and Palace for you. One of the most iconic forts in Jaipur, Amber Fort is steeped in history and remains a glorious example of architectural brilliance. The fort includes magnificent structures like the Sheesh Mahal, Shukh Niwas, and the Diwan-e-Khas or Hall of Private Audience. The light and sound show held here every evening brings alive the fort and its history, which is something you must not miss out on.

                    Amer Palace is great example of Rajput architecture. Some of its buildings and work have influence of Mughal architecture.Constructed of red sandstone and marble, the attractive, opulent palace is laid out on four levels, each with a courtyard. It consists of the Diwan-e-Aam, or "Hall of Public Audience", the Diwan-e-Khas, or "Hall of Private Audience", the Sheesh Mahal (mirror palace), or Jai Mandir, and the Sukh Niwas where a cool climate is artificially created by winds that blow over a water cascade within the palace. Hence, the Amer Fort is also popularly known as the Amer Palace.</p>

            <img src="../image/jaipur2.jpg">
                <p>The rocky ridges of the Aravali Hills cradle Nahargarh Fort, a majestic monument that overlooks Jaipur and offers a stunning view of the city's landscape. Built in 1734 by Jai Singh II, the then Maharaja of Jaipur, Nahargarh Fort was part of the city's defense circle, along with Amer Fort and Jaigarh Fort. The fort served as a hunting retreat for the royal family. Today it is a splendid viewpoint to watch glorious sunsets over the Pink City.

                Nahargarh Fort stands on the edge of the Aravalli Hills, overlooking the city of Jaipur in the Indian state of Rajasthan. Along with Amer Fort and Jaigarh Fort, Nahargarh once formed a strong defence ring for the city. The fort was originally named Sudershangarh, but it became known as Nahargarh, which means 'abode of tigers'. The popular belief is that Nahar here stands for Nahar Singh Bhomia, whose spirit haunted the place and obstructed construction of the fort. Nahar's spirit was pacified by building a temple in his memory within the fort, which thus became known by his name.</p>
